This creates an opportunity for end-users who want to automate and customize their web experiences, but the growing complexity of web pages and standards prevents most users from realizing this opportunity. We describe Chickenfoot, a programming system embedded in the Firefox web browser, which enables end-users to automate, customize, and integrate web applications without examining their source code. One way Chickenfoot addresses this goal is a novel technique for identifying page components by keyword pattern matching. We motivate this technique by studying how users name web page components, and present a heuristic keyword matching algorithm that identifies the desired component from the user’s name.","2005","2019-12-27 16:26:22","2019-12-27 20:41:26","2019-12-27 16:26:22","163","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Press","Seattle, WA, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/JS89G2G2/Bolin et al. - 2005 - Automation and customization of rendered web pages.pdf","","Wildcard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the 18th annual ACM symposium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that the power of these principles lies in their combination. Reification creates new objects that can be acted upon by a small set of polymorphic commands, creating more opportunities for reuse. The result is a simpler yet more powerful interface. To validate these principles, we describe their application in the redesign of a complex interface for editing and simulating Coloured Petri Nets. The cpn2000 interface integrates floating palettes, toolglasses and marking menus in a consistent manner with a new metaphor for managing the workspace. It challenges traditional ideas about user interfaces, getting rid of pull-down menus, scrollbars, and even selection, while providing the same or greater functionality.

This paper presents the ﬁrst visual query system to meet all three requirements in a single design. By directly manipulating nested relational results, and using spreadsheet idioms such as formulas and ﬁlters, the user can express a relationally complete set of query operators plus calculation, aggregation, outer joins, sorting, and nesting, while always remaining able to track and modify the state of the complete query. Our prototype gives the user an experience of responsive, incremental query building while pushing all actual query processing to the database layer.

V.","A Spreadsheet Algebra for a Direct Data Manipulation Query Interface","2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","","","10.1109/ICDE.2009.34","","A spreadsheet-like ""direct manipulation"" interface is more intuitive for many non-technical database users compared to traditional alternatives, such as visual query builders. The construction of such a direct manipulation interface may appear straightforward, but there are some significant challenges. First, individual direct manipulation operations cannot be too complex, so expressive power has to be achieved through composing (long) sequences of small operations. Second, all intermediate results are visible to the user, so grouping and ordering are material after every small step. Third, users often find the need to modify previously specified queries. Since manipulations are specified one step at a time, there is no actual queryexpression to modify. Suitable means must be provided to address this need. Fourth, the order in which manipulations are performed by the user should not affect the results obtained, to avoid user confusion. We address the aforementioned challenges by designing a new spreadsheet algebra that: i) operates on recursively grouped multi-sets, ii) contains a selectively designed set of operators capable of expressing at least all single-block SQL queries and can be intuitively implemented in a spreadsheet, iii) enables query modification by the notion of modifiable query state, and iv) requires no ordering in unary data manipulation operators since they are all designed to commute. We built a prototype implementation of the spreadsheet algebra and show, through user studies with non-technical subjects, that the resultant query interface is easier to use than a standard commercial visual query builder.","2009-03","2020-04-20 18:09:32","2020-04-20 18:09:32","","417-428","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2375-026X","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/M3AFJ2UA/Liu and Jagadish - 2009 - A Spreadsheet Algebra for a Direct Data Manipulati.pdf; /Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/576BWR2D/4812422.html","","","Algebra; Data analysis; Data engineering; database usability; direct data manipulation query interface; Humans; Presses; Prototypes; query processing; Relational databases; single-block SQL queries; spreadsheet; spreadsheet algebra; spreadsheet programs; Spreadsheet programs; SQL; USA Councils; user interface; Visual databases; visual query builders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2009 IEEE 25th International Conference on Data Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over time, their adaptations and the tailoring processes themselves become structured and systematized within the organization. This tendency toward systematization is in part a response to the requirement that the results of tailoring be sharable across groups of users. Our study focuses on several dimensions of the work of tailoring: construction, organizational change, learning, and politics.

This creates an opportunity for end users who want to automate and customize their Web experiences, but the growing complexity of Web pages and standards prevents most users from realizing this opportunity. This chapter describes Chickenfoot, a programming system embedded in the Firefox Web browser, which enables end users to automate, customize, and integrate Web applications without examining their source code. One way Chickenfoot addresses this goal is a technique for identifying page components by keyword pattern matching. We motivate this technique by studying how users name Web page components, and present a heuristic keyword matching algorithm that identifies the desired component from the user’s name. We describe a range of applications that have been created using Chickenfoot and reflect on its advantages and limitations.","2010","2020-05-16 15:06:39","2020-05-16 15:06:39","2020-05-16 15:06:39","39-63","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-381541-5.00003-1","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/L74PCDWX/Miller et al. - 2010 - Rewriting the Web with Chickenfoot.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have found that two of the challenges faced by these workers are automation of repetitive tasks, and support for complex or hard-to-remember tasks. This chapter presents CoScripter, a system that enables users to capture, share, and automate tasks on the Web. CoScripter’s most notable features include ClearScript, a scripting language that is both human-readable and machine-understandable, and built-in support for sharing via a Web-based script repository. CoScripter has been used by tens of thousands of people on the Web. Our user studies show that CoScripter has helped people both automate repetitive Web tasks, and share how-to knowledge inside the enterprise.","2010","2020-05-16 15:06:41","2020-05-16 15:06:41","2020-05-16 15:06:41","85-104","","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-381541-5.00005-5","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/U84JQNIC/Cypher et al. - 2010 - Collaborative scripting for the Web.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An alternative is to write scripts that pull data through APIs. This provides a cleaner way to access data than scraping; however, APIs are effortful for programmers and nigh-impossible for non-programmers to use. In this work, we empower users to access APIs without programming. We evolve a schema for declaratively specifying how to interact with a data API. We then develop ScrAPIr: a standard query GUI that enables users to fetch data through any API for which a specification exists, and a second GUI that lets users author and share the specification for a given API. From a lab evaluation, we find that even non-programmers can access APIs using ScrAPIr, while programmers can access APIs 3.8 times faster on average using ScrAPIr than using programming.","2020-04-21","2020-05-19 02:44:25","2020-05-19 02:44:25","2020-05-18","1–12","","","","","","ScrAPIr","CHI '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Honolulu, HI, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/AXSUQGM7/Alrashed et al. - 2020 - ScrAPIr Making Web Data APIs Accessible to End Us.pdf","","","api description language; web apis; web scraping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We believe that a useful technique is to have end users tailor their systems to match their personal work practices. This requires not only systems which can be tailored, but a culture within which users feel in control of the system and in which tailoring is the norm. In a two-pronged research project we have worked closely with a group of users to develop a system to support tailoring and to help the users evolve a “tailoring culture”. This has resulted in a flexible system based around the use of distributed on-screen Buttons to support a range of tailoring techniques.","1990","2020-05-20 03:03:00","2020-05-20 03:03:00","2020-05-20 03:03:00","175-182","","","","","","User-tailorable systems","","","","","ACM Press","Seattle, Washington, United States","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/PT5BEQ7D/MacLean et al. - 1990 - User-tailorable systems pressing the issues with .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","the SIGCHI conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article we seek a cognitive account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena that give rise to the feeling of directness. O n e deals with the information processing distance between the user’s intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling of directness of manipulation.","1985","2020-05-21 01:46:30","2020-05-21 01:47:03","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/geoffreylitt/Zotero/storage/NACHFDN3/Hutchins et al. - Direct Manipulation Interfaces.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
