<h1 class="title">Table-Driven Customization of Web Applications</h1>
</header>
<p>In this paper we propose <em>table-driven customization,</em> a new paradigm for enabling end users to customize software applications without doing traditional programming<em>.</em> Users directly manipulate a tabular view of the structured data inside the application, rather than writing imperative scripts as in most customization tools. We extend this simple model with a spreadsheet formula language and custom data editing widgets, which provide sufficient expressivity to implement many useful customizations.</p>
<p>We describe Wildcard, a browser extension which demonstrates table-driven customization in the context of web applications. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be used to create useful customizations for a variety of real applications. We share reflections from our usage of the Wildcard system, including its strengths and limitations relative to other customization approaches. We further explore how new software architectures might help application developers promote this style of end-user customization.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction" data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>There have been many attempts at empowering end users to customize their software by offering them a simplified programming tool. Some scripting languages (AppleScript, Chickenfoot) have a friendly syntax that resembles natural language. Visual programming tools (Mac Automator, Zapier) eliminate text syntax entirely. Macro recorders (Applescript, Helena, WebVCR) remove some of the initial programming burden by letting a user start by concrete demonstrations.</p>
<p>These approaches have many differences, but they all share something in common: an imperative programming model, with mutable variables, conditionals and loops. End users ultimately must use these traditional programming constructs to express their ideas, and the object of interest is fundamentally a <em>script</em>, a sequence of commands.</p>
<p>We have known for decades about an alternate approach: <em>direct manipulation</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="shneiderman1983">[<a href="#ref-shneiderman1983" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>, where “visibility of the object of interest” replaces “complex command language syntax”. Direct manipulation is the de facto standard in GUIs today, but when it comes time to customize software, it is rarely to be found. In this work, we ask: what would it look like to build a software customization interface that deeply relies on direct manipulation? We take inspiration from spreadsheets and visual database query interfaces <span class="citation" data-cites="2020a bakke2016">[<a href="#ref-bakke2016" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2020a" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>, which enable users to construct queries, edit data, and compute derived values through direct manipulation. These tools have successfully enabled millions of end users to compute with data more easily than ever before.</p>
<p>In this paper we present a technique called <em>table-driven customization</em> which applies these ideas from visual query interfaces in the context of software customization. We provide the end user with a table view where they can directly see and manipulate a structured projection of the internal state of an application. Changes in the table view result in immediate corresponding changes to the original user interface of the application, enabling the user to customize an application with live feedback.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we have developed a browser extension called Wildcard which implements table-driven customization in the context of the Web. Wildcard works with existing applications by using web scraping techniques to extract relevant state into a table, and to reify changes back into the original application UI. In Section 2 we present a many examples of using Wildcard to implement useful customizations across real websites, ranging from sorting lists of data to adding whole new features to applications.</p>
<p>In Section 3 we explain the architecture of the Wildcard system, focusing on <em>table adapters</em> which define the semantics of how a data table is connected to some underlying state. We explain how the abstractions of table-driven customization are general enough to support many customizations beyond the ones we’ve built so far in Wildcard. We also explore how applications themselves could be re-architected to expose tabular data to end users, rather than relying on web scraping techniques.</p>
<p>Table-driven customization embodies several design principles for building customizable software systems, described in Section 4:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data-oriented programming</em>: End users should be able to customize an application by examining and modifying its data, rather than by issuing imperative commands to an API</li>
<li><em>Black-box + semantic</em>: Typically, “black-box” customization tools, which don’t rely on official extension APIs, resort to offering low-level APIs for customization. Instead, we suggest a third-party community of semantic wrappers, offering end users a more convenient semantic API for customization, even if it wasn’t built in by the original developer.</li>
<li><em>Gentle slope</em>: Customization tools should offer a “gentle slope” from normal use to customization. We explore how our approach offers end users opportunities to start customizing software with almost no effort, which we hope can make customization a viable part of everyday software usage rather than a rare event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table-driven customization relates to existing work in many areas. Our goals overlap with many software customization tools, in the browser and on the desktop. Our methods overlap with direct manipulation interfaces for working with data, including visual database query systems and spreadsheets. We explore these connections and more in Section 5.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="sec:examples" data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Examples</h1>
<p><em>This section still todo. Borrow heavily from Convivial paper, but extend with newer results</em></p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="sec:architecture" data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> System architecture</h1>
<p>The basic data unit in table-driven customization is a Table: an ordered list of tuples, each of which has an ID and some attributes. The user always sees a single table in the table editor, but this table is the result of combining data across one or more underlying tables, much like viewing the result of a SQL query across multiple database tables. Each individual table’s data is managed by a “table adapter” component, and a query engine coordinates across the various table adapters.</p>
<p>(<em>Todo: drive this explanation via concrete Instacart example. Add a figure.</em>) For example, one table adapter manages scraping data from the DOM of a site, while another manages extracting data from AJAX requests. Each table adapter produces a table of data, and the two are joined together by a shared ID column to produce what looks like a single table of data extracted from the site. Similarly, when the user makes annotations on a site, these annotations are handled by a third table adapter, which manages a data table stored in the browser’s local storage.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="table-adapter-api" data-number="3.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Table adapter API</h2>
<p>(<em>Todo: formalize this more? Would math notation help?</em>)</p>
<p>In order to promote uniformity within the system, we’ve defined a small abstract API, which all table adapters conform to.</p>
<p>The main purpose of a table adapter is to return a table representing some data source. The table is live-updating: a table adapter can produce a new version of its data table at any point (e.g., updating the data table in response to a change in a website’s DOM). When this happens the new data is pushed to the editor and the query results are refreshed.</p>
<p>Table editors also accept various incoming commands.</p>
<p>The editor can request to a table adapter to make an edit to a record. The meaning of making an edit can vary depending on the adapter: in the local storage adapter, an annotation can be persisted into local storage; in the DOM scraping adapter, an edit can represent filling in a form field. An adapter can also mark values as read-only if it wouldn’t be meaningful to edit them; for example, the DOM scraping adapter typically marks page content as read-only, except for editable form fields.</p>
<p>The query engine also sends each table adapter information about the entire cross-table query view being created by the user. This functionality is currently mainly used by the DOM scraping adapter to make changes to the original web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>observes the sort order of the query view to re-order rows in the page</li>
<li>observes the content of other joined tables to render annotations in the page</li>
<li>observes the currently selected row in the UI, to highlight the corresponding row in the page</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="table-adapters" data-number="3.2"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Table adapters</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.2.1" id="existing-adapters" data-number="3.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Existing adapters</h3>
<p>Here we describe the three types of table adapters which we have implemented so far to power the customizations shown above.</p>
<p><strong>DOM scraping adapters</strong> are a key part of the Wildcard system. These adapters extract data from the DOM of a web page, and manipulate the DOM to re-order rows, edit form entries, and inject annotations. To create a DOM scraping adapter for a specific website, a programmer only needs to write a single function which returns scraped data and pointers to relevant DOM elements; the Wildcard framework uses this function to implement the rest of the needed functionality.</p>
<p>An <strong>AJAX scraping adapter</strong> intercepts AJAX requests made by a web page, and extracts information from those requests. A programmer writes a function which specifies how to extract data from an AJAX request, and the framework handles the details of actually intercepting requests and calling the programmer-defined function.</p>
<p>The <strong>local storage adapter</strong> simply stores a table of data in the browser.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.2.2" id="future-adapters" data-number="3.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Future Adapters</h3>
<p>We have designed the table adapter API to be general enough to additional types of functionality in the future. Here are three concrete examples of hypothetical possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Integrated website adapters</strong>: A key benefit of the table adapter abstraction is that Wildcard is not coupled to web scraping as the only means for integrating with existing sites, but can also accommodate first party developers adding support directly into their own websites. A DOM Scraping table adapter could be swapped out for such an “integrated website adapter,” which implements the exact same interface as a scraping adapter but by directly accessing the internal state of the user interface, without needing any scraping logic.</p>
<p>We think it is possible to create such adapters for existing frontend web frameworks which result in minimal effort on the part of the application developers. For example, we have created an initial prototype of a plugin for the Redux state management library. Redux implements the Model-View-Update pattern, which represents the entire state of a user interface as a single centralized object. To configure an integrated website adapter for such an existing application, the user can simply specify a function projecting the centralized application state as a table, and define handlers for how data edits to the table should affect the state.</p>
<p><strong>Shared storage adapter</strong>: It would be useful to share user annotations between people and across devices—for example, collaboratively taking notes with friends on a list of options for places to stay on Airbnb. The existing Local Storage Adapter could be extended to share live synchronized data with other users. This could be achieved through a centralized web server (perhaps an existing service like Google Sheets capable of storing tabular data), or through P2P connections which might improve the privacy guarantees available for the shared annotations.</p>
<p><strong>Third party API data adapter</strong>: Currently, the main mechanism for including data from web APIs in Wildcard is using spreadsheet formulas. However, a web API could also be wrapped to expose a table API that would dynamically create tables in response to queries. For example, when fetching walkability scores for many GPS locations, the query engine could request a table of walkability scores for various pairs of latitude and longitude, and the table adapter could dynamically perform API queries to populate a result table. (<em>todo: why is this better than spreadsheet formulas? I don’t think it offers any more room for batching performance optimization because we’ve already framed formulas as whole-column, not row specific</em>)</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="query-engine" data-number="3.3"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Query engine</h2>
<p>The query engine is responsible for coordinating across multiple table adapters. It joins data across multiple tables and creates a single result table which is shown to the user through the editor. It also handles all user interactions and routes appropriate messages to each table adapter.</p>
<p>First, every query involves a primary DOM scraping table adapter which associates records in the result with elements in the application’s user interface. At minimum, the primary table adapter needs to return record IDs and have the ability to manipulate the application’s UI. It can also optionally return data about each record.</p>
<p>Next, additional tables (AJAX data, local storage data) are left joined by ID. (<em>todo: discuss IDs here?</em>) Finally, the result table can be sorted and filtered by any column.</p>
<p>One way to think of this model is a tiny constrained subset of the SQL query model. We’ve found that this simple model has proven sufficient for meeting the needs of customization in practice, and minimizes the complexity of supporting more general and arbitrary queries. But because it fits into the general SQL paradigm, it could theoretically be extended to support more types of queries.</p>
<p>The query engine is also responsible for executing formulas. We have built a small language resembling the formula languages in visual query tools like SIEUFERD. As in those tools, and unlike in spreadsheets, formulas automatically apply to an entire column of data, and can reference entire columns rather than only specific cells.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="table-editor" data-number="3.4"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Table editor</h2>
<p>In Wildcard we provide a basic table editor as the user interface on top of the query engine. It is built with the Handsontable Javascript library, which provides UI elements for viewing and editing a table, as well as basic query operations like sorting and filtering.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="sec:design-principles" data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Design principles</h1>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="data-oriented-programming" data-number="4.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Data-oriented programming</h2>
<p>(<em>todo: I used some of this material in the Introduction, need to differentiate</em>)</p>
<p>There have been many attempts at simplifying aspects of traditional programming to enable non-programmer end users to perform customization. End user scripting languages (AppleScript, VBA, Chickenfoot, CoScripter) have innovated at the syntax level, aiming to improve ease-of-use. Visual programming environments (Mac Automator, Zapier) go further by eliminating text syntax entirely, but maintain the same computational model. Programming-by-demonstration and macro recording environments (Applescript, Helena, WebVCR) remove some of the initial programming burden by starting with concrete demonstrations, but typically require programming later in the process.</p>
<p>However, all of these approaches share something in common: <strong>an imperative programming model</strong>. They all involve a list of commands executed in sequence, with control flow constructs like conditionals and loops, and mutable variables. This makes some intuitive sense: many customizations seem most naturally expressed as a series of commands, each of which has a side effect on the UI: first enter this value, then click this button, etc. The result is that end users eventually need to become familiar with all of these traditional imperative programming constructs, even if only in diluted form. (todo: bolster the case that this is a barrier to learning)</p>
<p>Imperative programming is not the only possible model. Spreadsheets have demonstrated another computational model: data editing via direct manipulation, combined with pure functional expressions for computation, with automatic reactive updates provided by the runtime. We call this a data-oriented model, because the user is focused on editing data values and producing the correct derived data values, rather than encoding a sequence of commands. The success of spreadsheets with end user programmers suggests that finding a way to apply data-oriented programming model to software customization might enable more people to modify their software. However, it’s not immediately obvious how the spreadsheet paradigm applies to customization.</p>
<p>A key insight from our work is that, rather than representing customization as a series of commands issued to an existing application, we can present a projected view of the application’s internal state, and let the user directly edit that projection as a means of customizing the application. In some sense, this is similar to the DOM inspector, which provides a user with an alternate representation of the UI that they can directly manipulate (e.g., by selecting an element and deleting it from the DOM tree). But rather than provide a low-level view of the user interface elements, we instead provide a higher-level view of the semantic state of the application.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="black-box-semantic" data-number="4.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Black-box + semantic</h2>
<p>Software customization tools typically fall into one of two categories: black-box, or semantic.</p>
<p><strong>Black-box customization tools</strong> enable customization without using official extension APIs, enabling a broader range of customizations on top of more applications. For example, web browser extensions have demonstrated the utility of customizing websites through manipulating the DOM, without needing explicit extension APIs to be built in. However, black-box customization comes with a corresponding cost: these tools can typically only operate at a low level of abstraction, e.g. manipulating user interface elements. This makes it harder for end users to write scripts, and makes the resulting scripts more brittle. (todo: support this claim more, provide examples)</p>
<p><strong>Semantic customization tools</strong> use explicit extension APIs provided by the application developer. Examples of this include accessing a backend web API, or writing a customization in Applescript that uses an application-specific API. The main benefit is that this allows the extension author to work with meaningful concepts in the application domain—“create a new calendar event” rather than “click the button that says new event.”—which makes customizations easier to build and more robust. However, this style limits the range of extensions that can be built, to only those which the official plugin API supports.</p>
<p>(<em>Footnote this paragraph?</em>) This categorization is slightly oversimplified, and there are existing customization ecosystems that span both categories. For example, part of the success of browser extensions stems from the fact that the DOM encourages the use of standardized semantic UI elements; even if an app developer doesn’t anticipate customization, merely using of semantic and accessible HTML creates a collateral benefit of easier extension. Another example of a middle ground is AppleScript, which provides system-wide low-level APIs for manipulating GUIs as a means of black-box customization, while also enabling developers to optionally add application-specific APIs to add support for semantic customization.</p>
<p>With Wildcard, we use a hybrid approach that takes the best of both worlds. Programmers implement an API wrapper that is internally implemented as a black-box customization, but externally provides a semantic interface to the application. End users get an ergonomic and simplified customization experience, but without the need to depend on a first-party application developer exposing extension APIs.</p>
<p>One way to view this approach is as introducing a new abstraction barrier into black-box extension. Typically, a black box customization script combines two responsibilities: 1) mapping the low-level details of a user interface to semantic constructs (e.g., using CSS selectors to find certain page elements), and 2) the actual logic of the specific customization. (todo: could easily show examples of this from browser extensions, Chickenfoot, etc) Even though the mapping logic is often more generic than the specific customization (e.g., finding a given input element is independent of what text to insert into that element), the intertwining of these two responsibilities in a single script makes it very difficult to share the mapping logic across scripts. With Wildcard we propose a decoupling of these two layers: a community-maintained mapping layer, shared across many specific customizations by individual users. This architecture has been successfully used by projects like Gmail.js, an open source project that creates a convenient API for browser extensions to interface with the Gmail web email client.</p>
