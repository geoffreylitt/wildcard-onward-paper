  Customizing software should be as easy as using it. But most customization methods require a dramatic shift, from using a GUI to writing scripts in a programming language.

  We introduce _data-driven customization_, a new way for end users to extend software by direct manipulation without doing traditional programming. We augment existing user interfaces with a table view showing the structured data inside the application. When users edit the table, their changes are reflected in the original UI. This simple model accommodates a spreadsheet formula language and custom data editing widgets, providing enough power to implement a variety of useful extensions.

  We illustrate the approach with Wildcard, a browser extension that implements data-driven customization on the web using web scraping. Through concrete examples, we show that this paradigm can support useful extensions to many real websites, and we share reflections from our experiences using Wildcard.

  Finally, we share our broader vision for a future where end users have greater access to the data in their applications, and better tools for taking advantage of that data in the context of everyday software usage.
