to me, Stephen
Dear authors,

Well done on getting your paper into the second round of Onward! Papers.
I just wanted to remind you of the resubmission rubric and fill in a few
details. The revision deadline remains 15th August (AoE).

- About the page limit: you may use the full 17-page (final) page limit
  for your second-round submission.

- In almost all cases, you have been given some specific revisions to
  attend to. Our rubric requires you to include a "cover letter"
  describing how you tackled these. This "letter" is probably best written
  simply as a HotCRP comment, mapping the revision requests to specific
  parts of the paper. You are welcome to draw attention (briefly) to other
  significant changes.

- To help the reviewers, I would ask you to include a _diff_ of some
  form, capturing what's changed between your original submission and the
  revised one. This is not obligatory but is very highly recommended, as
  it will help the reviewers focus their attention. For LaTeX, 'latexdiff'
  usually works pretty well. For Word and the like, either Track Changes
  or a Compare tool may make this easy. If you need advice, feel free to
  ask (no promises! but I'll do what I can to help).

- I will create a new file upload field on the submission page that you
  can use for the diff. To submit the revised paper itself, you should
  resubmit the paper proper. I will do my best to ensure the settings are
  correct to allow all this... if you run into problems, please let me
  know.

- If you're concerned by some of the reviewers' comments in a way that
  affects your ability to make the revisions, e.g. if you think there is a
  misunderstanding which is leading the revision requests to be
  nonsensical, you may contact me and I'll use my discretion about whether
  to forward this to the reviewers. I'm not expecting this to be
  necessary, and it's not an invitation for rebuttal-style "author
  responses", but it's there for any unusual cases that might pop up.

- The second-round submission remains blinded, so please do not reveal
  your identities to the reviewers at this stage.

That is all... please do ask if you have questions, and good luck with
your revisions,
